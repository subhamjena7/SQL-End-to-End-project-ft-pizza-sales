# SQL End-to-End Project ft. Pizza Sales

## Introduction
Welcome to the SQL End-to-End Project featuring Pizza Sales! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a pizza sales dataset using SQL queries to derive valuable insights. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, this project has something for you.

## Dataset
The project uses four CSV files, each representing a different aspect of the pizza sales data:

1. **order_details.csv**
   - order_details_id
   - order_id
   - pizza_id
   - quantity

2. **orders.csv**
   - order_id
   - date
   - time

3. **pizza_types.csv**
   - pizza_type_id
   - name
   - category
   - ingredients

4. **pizzas.csv**
   - pizza_id
   - pizza_type_id
   - size
   - price

## Approach
We will use SQL queries to solve a series of questions categorized into Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced levels.

### Basic
1. **Retrieve the total number of orders placed.**
2. **Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.**
3. **Identify the highest-priced pizza.**
4. **Identify the most common pizza size ordered.**
5. **List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.**

### Intermediate
1. **Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.**
2. **Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.**
3. **Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.**
4. **Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.**
5. **Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.**

### Advanced
1. **Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.**
2. **Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.**
3. **Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.**
